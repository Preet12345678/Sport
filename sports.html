Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone; at any age and any point in life. Adults, children and elders – everyone alike can take part in sports.

To achieve overall and all-round development in life, one should be well-versed in both sports and culture. While training sharpens the mind, sports sharpens the body and fitness. Thus, both are essential. There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports.
